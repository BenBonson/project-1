# project-1




# records 
1. started with navigation, tried multiple html pages but figured that this should be more go centered
2. restarted and made an index html
3. index displays source code when in its own file but does it properly in the same one
4. server stopped working
5. in confusion tested older projects and examples, they don't work either...eventhough I haven't touched them...very confused
6. localhost:9000 wont work tried 3000 and 7000 and they work ???
7. Now index displays its source code in the same file ???
8. Lots of testing and things only broke more now attempting to connect to local host says connection was reset
9. found and fixed the issue but it still displays the source code not in html format
10. added response.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/html; charset=utf-8") now html displays correctly
11. Tried to work on getting top to work, its not displayig anything
12. main.go now displays all the html with top included, however it does so in the command line
13. Got the results to print in HTML, its pretty ugly
